## 🌌 Overview

**Retinal AI** is a deep learning–based system designed to detect and classify **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** severity from retinal fundus images. It uses **ResNet-based CNN models (PyTorch)** and a **modern Tkinter GUI** with a dark gradient theme for a professional hospital interface.

The system allows clinicians and users to:
- Upload retinal fundus images for analysis
- Get real-time AI-powered DR severity predictions
- View detailed diagnostic reports
- Access verified ophthalmologists across Tamil Nadu
- Provide feedback for continuous improvement

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

> **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in adults.**

### Key Challenges:
- Manual diagnosis requires trained ophthalmologists and is time-consuming
- Lack of experts in rural and remote areas delays early detection and treatment
- Early detection significantly improves patient outcomes and prevents permanent vision loss
- AI-based screening systems can reduce diagnostic burden and democratize healthcare access

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

A **ResNet-based CNN** model (trained on APTOS 2019 dataset) predicts DR severity from 0–4:

| Label | Condition | Description |
|:-----:|:-----------|:------------|
| 0 | 🟢 No DR | No diabetic retinopathy detected |
| 1 | 🟡 Mild | Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy |
| 2 | 🟠 Moderate | Moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy |
| 3 | 🔴 Severe | Severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy |
| 4 | ⚫ Proliferative DR | Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (highest severity) |

Users can log in, upload retinal images, get diagnostic predictions, and contact nearby ophthalmologists for follow-up care.
